# Drama vs. Drama

This is a repository for a second year course paper project, based on the existing card game developed by Frank Fischer and colleagues, the data for which can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.6667424.v1) and [here](https://github.com/lehkost/dramenquartett).

All the datasets are based on the [Drama Corpus Project](https://dracor.org).
The aim of the code here is to simulate a card game process to acquire the game statistics which can then be analysed.

The main code can be found [here](../blob/master/dramavsdrama.ipynb), the data on which it is based â€” [here](../blob/master/canon.csv).
The code processing the acquired data is available [here](../blob/master/data/stats.ipynb), and all the additional datasets for possible future use are [here](../tree/master/data) and [here](../tree/master/corpora).
